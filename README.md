# DeepWaterStudio Rework

For this project I wanted to learn how Tailwind and framer-motion worked so I picked a site I felt inspired by and customize it.
[DeepWaterStudio](https://www.deepwaterstudios.xyz/) web site has been choosen for this purpose.
I added some animations for each section and reworked how projects are displayed. I created 2 view for these projects :

- Bowser view where project's card expand while hovered.
- Mobile view where project's card is flipped on click.
